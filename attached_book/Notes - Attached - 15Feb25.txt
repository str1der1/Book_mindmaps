Having a perpetually activated attachment system is the opposite of what nature had in mind for us in terms of gratifying love.


Blue highlight | Page: 92
As we’ve seen, one of Bowlby and Ainsworth’s most important insights is that in order to thrive and grow as human beings, we need a secure base from which to derive strength and comfort. For that to happen, our attachment system must be calm and secure.


Yellow highlight | Page: 93
Remember, an activated attachment system is not passionate love. Next time you date someone and find yourself feeling anxious, insecure, and obsessive—only to feel elated every once in a while—tell yourself this is most likely an activated attachment system and not love!


Yellow highlight | Page: 93
True love, in the evolutionary sense, means peace of mind. “Still waters run deep” is a good way of characterizing it.


Yellow highlight | Page: 94
People with an avoidant attachment style tend to end their relationships more frequently. One study found that of individuals who entered a new marriage following a divorce, the avoidant ones were more likely to divorce again. They also suppress loving emotions and therefore “get over” partners very quickly so they can start dating again almost immediately. Conclusion: Avoidants are in the dating pool more frequently and for longer periods of time.


Yellow highlight | Page: 94
Studies have found that avoidants are unlikely to be in a relationship with other avoidants, because they lack the emotional glue to stay together. In fact, one study that looked at dating couples didn’t find even one pair that was avoidant-avoidant. Conclusion: Avoidants don’t date each other; they are more likely to date people with different attachment styles.


Yellow highlight | Page: 95
When you meet someone new, the probability that they have an avoidant attachment style is high—much higher than their relative size in the population—25 percent. Not only are they recycled back into the dating pool more quickly, but they are not dating one another (at least not for long), nor are they dating secure people, that much because secures are less available. Who are they meeting? That’s right: You and other potential partners with an anxious attachment style.


Yellow highlight | Page: 96
Chloe met him once and was utterly uninterested. She conceded that he was very handsome and even attractive, but “the spark was missing.”


Yellow highlight | Page: 96
In hindsight, we do understand: If you are anxious, the reverse of what happens when you meet someone avoidant happens when you meet someone secure. The messages that come across from someone secure are very honest, straightforward, and consistent. Secures are not afraid of intimacy and know they are worthy of love. They don’t have to beat around the bush or play hard to get. Ambiguous messages are out of the mix, as are tension and suspense. As a result, your attachment system remains relatively calm.


Yellow highlight | Page: 96
you are used to equating an activated attachment system with love, you conclude that this can’t be “the one” because no bells are going off. You associate a calm attachment system with boredom and indifference. Because of this fallacy you might let the perfect partner pass you by.


Yellow highlight | Page: 97
The trick is not to get hooked on the highs and lows and mistake an activated attachment system for passion or love. Don’t let emotional unavailability turn you on.


Yellow highlight | Page: 101
Addresses your concerns as “in a court of law”—responding to the facts without taking your feelings into account.


Yellow highlight | Page: 101
A new way of dating: Be your authentic self and use effective communication. The next step is to start expressing your needs. Most anxious people easily fall into the trap that relationship books—and society at large—set for them. They feel that they are too demanding and needy and so they try to accommodate their partner’s need for distance and boundaries (if they’re involved with someone avoidant). It’s simply more socially acceptable to maintain a cool,


Yellow highlight | Page: 101
In actuality, you are missing out when you do so, because by expressing those needs you achieve two goals. First, you are being your authentic self, which has been found to contribute to our general feelings of happiness and fulfillment, and being happy and fulfilled is probably one of the most attractive traits you can offer a partner. Second and no less important, once you are your authentic self, if your partner is incapable of meeting your genuine needs, you can determine that early on.

But Janet believed that if she held out long enough, giving him his space and plenty of time, he would learn to appreciate her. That if she played it cool and self-assured, he would be more attracted to her. Perhaps not surprisingly, Janet’s relationship with Brian slowly deteriorated

finally disappeared without even a real break-up talk.


Yellow highlight | Page: 103
The abundance philosophy. As we discussed earlier in the chapter, there are a disproportionate number of avoidants in the dating pool. Another useful step for successfully maneuvering through the pool is what we call the abundance (or “plenty of fish in the sea”) philosophy—understanding that there are many unique and wonderful individuals out there who may be superb partners for you.


Yellow highlight | Page: 104
The only way to make sure that you meet potential soul mates is to go out with a lot of people. It’s a simple law of probability—the more you meet, the greater the chances you’ll find the one who is a good match for you.


Yellow highlight | Page: 104
By using the abundance philosophy, you maintain your ability to evaluate potential partners more objectively. What you are actually doing is desensitizing your attachment system and tricking it into being easier on you. Your system will no longer get so easily activated by one person because it will be busy evaluating the availability of a lot of different people, and you won’t be as likely to obsess about anyone in particular.


Yellow highlight | Page: 104
You can quickly rule out people if they make you feel insecure or inadequate, because you haven’t built all your hopes on them.

she craved intimacy and closeness but was so convinced that she would never meet anyone that being alone had become a self-fulfilling prophecy.


Yellow highlight | Page: 105
not returning phone calls and remaining silent (using protest behavior)


Yellow highlight | Page: 105
Later she would torment herself by turning things over and over in her mind (an activating strategy).


Yellow highlight | Page: 106
When she met someone she really liked, she obsessed about him less and didn’t resort as much to protest behavior. Gone (or at least reduced) were the oversensitivity and the defensiveness that made her act in self-defeating ways.


Yellow highlight | Page: 107
Remind yourself that you might feel bored at first—after all, there is less drama when your attachment system isn’t activated.


Yellow highlight | Page: 107
if you hold out a little longer, you may start to appreciate a calm attachment system and all the advantages it has to offer.


Yellow highlight | Page: 107
common trap of equating avoidance with masculinity. Research findings, however, prove that there are many men who are far from being avoidant—


Yellow highlight | Page: 107
Another misperception is that we associate the anxious attachment style with femininity when in fact most women are secure


Yellow highlight | Page: 107
However, it is important to keep in mind that there are also women who fit the avoidant description. When it comes to attachment and gender, the most important fact to remember is that the majority of the population—both male and female—are secure.


Yellow highlight | Page: 112
Whether you are single or involved in a relationship, even a committed one, you are always maneuvering to keep people at a distance.


Yellow highlight | Page: 113
Avoidants, it appears, are quick to think negatively about their partners, seeing them as needy and overly dependent—a major element in their view of relationships—but ignore their own needs and fears about relationships.


Yellow highlight | Page: 116
All of these people have one thing in common: an avoidant attachment style. They feel a deep-rooted aloneness, even while in a relationship. Whereas people with a secure attachment style find it easy to accept their partners, flaws and all, to depend on them, and to believe that they’re


Yellow highlight | Page: 116
If you’re avoidant, you connect with romantic partners but always maintain some mental distance and an escape route.


Yellow highlight | Page: 116
they’re all employing techniques known as deactivating strategies. A deactivating strategy is any behavior or thought that is used to squelch intimacy. These strategies suppress our attachment system, the biological mechanism in our brains responsible for our desire to seek closeness with a preferred partner.


Yellow highlight | Page: 116
researchers showed that avoidants have the need for closeness in a relationship but make a concerted effort to repress it?


Yellow highlight | Page: 117
Examine the following list of deactivating strategies carefully. The more you use these tools, the more alone you’ll feel and the less happy you’ll be in your relationship.


Yellow highlight | Page: 118
these small everyday deactivating strategies are tools you unconsciously use to make sure the person that you love (or will love) won’t get in the way of your autonomy. But at the end of the day, these tools are standing in the way of you being happy in a relationship.


Yellow highlight | Page: 118
As an avoidant, you have a skewed perspective of the things that your partner says and does. The unnerving part is that you’re almost entirely unconscious of these unconstructive thought patterns.


Yellow highlight | Page: 119
Joe’s belief in self-reliance—and his experience of feeling alone because of it—isn’t unique to him. Studies show that belief in self-reliance is very closely linked with a low degree of comfort with intimacy and closeness.


Blue highlight | Page: 119
avoidant individuals were found to have a great deal of confidence about not needing anyone else, their belief came with a price tag: They scored lowest on every measure of closeness in personal relationships. They were less willing to engage in self-disclosure, less comfortable with intimacy, and also less likely to seek help from others.


Yellow highlight | Page: 119
strong belief in self-reliance can be more of a burden than an asset. In romantic relationships, it reduces your ability to be close,


Yellow highlight | Page: 119
Many avoidants confuse self-reliance with independence. Even though it’s important for each of us to be able to stand on our own two feet, if we overrate self-reliance, we diminish the importance of getting support from other people, thus cutting ourselves off from an important lifeline.


Yellow highlight | Page: 119
Another problem with self-reliance is the “self” part. It forces you to ignore the needs of your partner and concentrate only on your own needs, shortchanging you of one of the most rewarding human experiences: It prevents you (and the person you love) from the joy of feeling part of something bigger than yourself.


Yellow highlight | Page: 120
Another disabling thought pattern that makes you keep your partner at a distance is “seeing the worm instead of the apple.”


Yellow highlight | Page: 120
“It will never work,” she said time and again. Finally, she broke up with him. Months later she was surprised by just how difficult she was finding things without him. Lonely, depressed, and heartbroken, she mourned their lost relationship as the best she’d ever had.


Yellow highlight | Page: 120
Carole’s experience is typical of people with an avoidant attachment style. They tend to see the glass half-empty instead of half-full when it comes to their partner.


Yellow highlight | Page: 120
They found that people with an avoidant attachment style rated their partner less positively than did non-avoidants. What’s more, they found they did so even on days in which their accounts of their partners’ behavior indicated supportiveness, warmth, and caring.


Yellow highlight | Page: 121
avoidants’ generally dismissive attitude toward connectedness. When something occurs that contradicts this perspective—such as their spouse behaving in a genuinely caring and loving manner—they are prone to ignoring the behavior, or at least diminishing its value.


Yellow highlight | Page: 121
focus on Bob’s negative attributes. Although she was aware of her boyfriend’s strengths, she couldn’t keep her mind off what she perceived to be his countless flaws.


Blue highlight | Page: 121
Only after they broke up, and she no longer felt threatened by the high level of intimacy, did her defense strategies lift. She was then able to get in touch with the underlying feelings of attachment that were there all along


Blue highlight | Page: 121
if you were a parent and couldn’t for the life of you read your infant’s cues. You wouldn’t be able to tell whether your child was hungry or tired, wanting to be held or wanting to be left alone, wet or sick. How difficult life would be for both of you. Your child would have to work so much harder—and cry so much longer—to be understood. Having an avoidant attachment style can often make you feel like that parent.


Blue highlight | Page: 122
along with your self-reliant attitude, you also train yourself not to care about how the person closest to you is feeling.


Blue highlight | Page: 122
It was common for avoidants to interpret their partner’s reaction as indifferent if they rated someone as highly attractive, when, in fact, their partner had been quite upset by it.


Yellow highlight | Page: 122
John Gray, in his enormously popular book Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus, starts out by describing the aha moment that made him write the book. Several days after his wife, Bonnie, gave birth to their baby girl in a very painful delivery, John went back to work (all signs showed she was on the mend). He came home at the end of the day, only to discover that his wife had run out of painkillers and had consequently “spent the whole day in pain, taking care of a newborn.” When he saw how upset she was, he misinterpreted her distress as anger and became very defensive—trying to plead his innocence. After all, he didn’t know she had run out of pills. Why hadn’t she called? After a heated exchange, he was about to stomp angrily out of the house when Bonnie stopped him: “Stop, please don’t leave,” she said. “This is when I need you most. I’m in pain. I haven’t slept in days. Please listen to me.”

Learn to identify deactivating strategies.


Blue highlight | Page: 127
Don’t act on your impulse. When you’re excited about someone but then suddenly have a gut feeling that s/he is not right for you, stop and think. Is this actually a deactivating strategy? Are all those small imperfections you’re starting to notice really your attachment system’s way of making you step back?


Blue highlight | Page: 127
Remind yourself that this picture is skewed and that you need intimacy despite your discomfort with it. If you thought s/he was great to begin with, you have a lot to lose by pushing him or her away.

De-emphasize self-reliance and focus on mutual support.


Blue highlight | Page: 128
When your partner feels s/he has a secure base to fall back on (and doesn’t feel the need to work hard to get close), and when you don’t feel the need to distance yourself, you’ll both be better able to look outward and do your own thing. You’ll become more independent and your partner will be less needy.

Make a relationship gratitude list.

Remind yourself on a daily basis that you tend to think negatively of your partner or date. It is simply part of your makeup if you have an avoidant attachment style.

with practice and perseverance, you’ll gradually get the hang of it.

Nix the phantom ex.

When you find yourself idealizing that one special ex-partner, stop and acknowledge that he or she is not (and never was) a viable option. By remembering how critical you were of that relationship—and how leery you were of committing—


Blue highlight | Page: 129
stop using him or her as a deactivating strategy


Orange highlight | Page: 129
Forget about “the one.”


Blue highlight | Page: 129
On the contrary, we wholeheartedly believe in the soul mate experience. But it is our belief that you have to be an active party in the process. Don’t wait until “the one” who fits your checklist shows up and then expect everything to fall into place.


Yellow highlight | Page: 129
Make them into your soul mate by choosing them out of the crowd, allowing them to get close (using the strategies we offer in this chapter) and making them a special part of you.


Orange highlight | Page: 129
Adopt the distraction strategy.


Blue highlight | Page: 129
As an avoidant, it’s easier to get close to your partner if there’s a distraction (remember the experiment with a distraction task). Focusing on other things—taking a hike, going sailing, or preparing a meal together—will allow you to let your guard down and make it easier to access your loving feelings.


Yellow highlight | Page: 131
Their emotional system doesn’t get too riled up in the face of threat (as with the anxious) but doesn’t get shut down either (as with the avoidant).


Yellow highlight | Page: 132
what happens when secure and insecure interact? In a separate experiment, researchers got observers to rate couples’ functioning during a joint interaction. It’s no surprise that secure couples—those in which both partners were secure—functioned better than insecure couples—those in which both partners were either anxious or avoidant. But what was more interesting was that there was no observed difference between secure couples and “mixed” couples—those with only one secure partner. They both showed less conflict and were rated as better functioning than were the “insecure” dyads.


Yellow highlight | Page: 133
they also create a buffering effect, somehow managing to raise their insecure partner’s relationship satisfaction and functioning to their own high level. This is a very important finding. It means that if you’re with someone secure, they nurture you into a more secure stance.


Yellow highlight | Page: 133
Secure people fit almost every description across the personality spectrum:


Yellow highlight | Page: 134
“I understand that you’re frightened and there might be some comfort for you if I feel frightened too, but if you’re trying to encourage me to be more efficient at work—which you often do—this isn’t the best way to do it.”


Yellow highlight | Page: 135
People with a secure attachment style, like Stan, are characterized by something very real but not outwardly visible—they are programmed to expect their partners to be loving and responsive and don’t worry much about losing their partners’ love. They feel extremely comfortable with intimacy and closeness and have an uncanny ability to communicate their needs and respond to their partners’ needs.


Yellow highlight | Page: 135
unlike avoidants, who didn’t react to these words initially but did react to them when they were distracted by another task, secures continued to overlook them even in the distraction condition.


Yellow highlight | Page: 136
it seems that what may come as hard work for some—to keep an even emotional keel in the face of threat—comes effortlessly for someone secure. They simply aren’t as sensitive to the negative cues of the world.


Yellow highlight | Page: 136
Effective communicators—They expect others to be understanding and responsive, so expressing their feelings freely and accurately to their partners comes naturally to them.


Yellow highlight | Page: 137
Responsible for their partners’ well-being—They expect others to be responsive and loving toward them and so are responsive to others’ needs.


Yellow highlight | Page: 138
Last, the secure party engulfs his or her partner in an emotionally protective shield that makes facing the outside world an easier task. We often fail to realize what a bonus these attributes are

John Bowlby believed that attachment styles are a function of life experience—especially of our interaction with our parents during infancy.


Yellow highlight | Page: 139
weak but significant link between the two—children of mothers who were sensitive to their needs were more likely to have a secure attachment style,


Yellow highlight | Page: 139
positive maternal conditions—marital satisfaction, low stress and depression, and social support—and fewer hours with a nonparental caretaker.


Yellow highlight | Page: 139
an idea that has been gaining scientific momentum in recent years is that we are genetically predisposed toward a certain attachment style. In a genetic association study, which examines whether a particular variant of a gene is more prevalent with one specific trait than with another, Omri Gillath, from the University of Kansas, and his colleagues from the University of California, Davis, discovered that a specific pattern of the dopamine receptor DRD2 allele is associated with the anxious attachment style, whereas a variant of the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor was linked to avoidance.


Yellow highlight | Page: 139
These two genes are known to play a role in many brain functions, including emotions, reward, attention, and importantly, also in social behavior and pair bonding. The authors conclude that “attachment insecurities are partially explained by particular genes, although there is still a great deal of individual difference variance that remains to be explained by other genes or social experiences.” In other words, genes may play an important role in determining our attachment style.


Yellow highlight | Page: 140
What is clear is that even if there is a correlation between attachment style in childhood and in adulthood, it is weak at best.


Yellow highlight | Page: 140
increasing evidence that a secure attachment style doesn’t originate from a single source.


Yellow highlight | Page: 140
to create this attachment pattern: our early connection with our parents, our genes, and also something else—our romantic experiences as adults.


Yellow highlight | Page: 140
about 70 to 75 percent of adults remain consistently in the same attachment category at different points in their lives, while the remaining 25 to 30 percent of the population report a change


Yellow highlight | Page: 140
Researchers attribute this change to romantic relationships in adulthood that are so powerful that they actually revise our most basic beliefs and attitudes toward connectedness. And yes, that change can happen in both directions—secure people can become less secure and people who were originally insecure can become increasingly secure. If you are insecure, this piece of information is vital and could be your ticket to happiness in relationships. If you are secure, you should be aware of this finding because you have a lot to lose by becoming less secure.

Unlike the anxious, you don’t let an activated attachment system distract you—you aren’t addicted to the highs and lows of being with someone who keeps you guessing all the time.


Yellow highlight | Page: 142
Unlike avoidants, you aren’t diverted by false fantasies of the perfect person waiting for you or “the one” that got away, and


Blue highlight | Page: 142
don’t unconsciously employ deactivating strategies that cause you to get cold feet when someone starts to get close.


Blue highlight | Page: 142
As a secure, the opposite is true of you—you believe that there are many potential partners open to intimacy and closeness who would be responsive to your needs. You know you deserve to be loved and valued


Yellow highlight | Page: 142
You are programmed to expect that. If someone sends out vibes that are not in line with these expectations—if they’re inconsistent or evasive—you automatically lose interest.


Yellow highlight | Page: 143
Notice that Tanya wastes no time at all on men she perceives as not being responsive enough to her needs.


Yellow highlight | Page: 143
It’s just a nonissue for her, and she instinctively moves on.


Yellow highlight | Page: 143
one of the tools most frequently used by people with a secure attachment style is effective communication—they simply surface their feelings and see how their date reacts.

Spotting “smoking guns” very early on


Yellow highlight | Page: 144
Subscribing to the belief that there are many (yes, many!) potential partners who could make you happy.


Yellow highlight | Page: 144
Expecting to be treated with respect, dignity, and love.


Yellow highlight | Page: 145
you’re secure, one of the reasons you’re able to maintain a satisfying relationship with someone who has an insecure attachment style is because he or she will gradually become more secure


Yellow highlight | Page: 145
Secure adults naturally know how to soothe their partners and take care of them—it’s an innate talent. This can be seen in the couple’s transition to parenthood.


Yellow highlight | Page: 145
during the shift into parenthood, anxiously attached women were more likely to move toward security in their interactions with their partners if they perceived their spouses as available, supportive, and accepting during pregnancy—all secure traits. In other words, secure adults’ sensitivity and encouragement have the same effect on their partners as the secure mother’s on her infant,


Yellow highlight | Page: 146
people with a secure attachment style view their partners’ well-being as their responsibility. As long as they have reason to believe their partner is in some sort of trouble, they’ll continue to back him or her.


Yellow highlight | Page: 147
“Forgiveness requires difficult regulatory maneuvers . . . understanding a transgressor’s needs and motives, and making generous attributions and appraisals concerning the transgressor’s traits and hurtful actions. . . . Secure people are likely to offer relatively benign explanations of their partners’ hurtful actions and be inclined to forgive the partner.” Also, as we’ve seen previously in this chapter, secure people just naturally dwell less on the negative and can turn off upsetting emotions without becoming defensively


Yellow highlight | Page: 147
The bad news is that when secure people do, on occasion, enter into a negative relationship, they might not know when to call it quits—especially if it’s a long-term, committed relationship in which they feel responsible for their partner’s happiness.


Yellow highlight | Page: 147
If you’re secure but start to feel agitated, worried, or jealous (anxious traits), or if you find yourself thinking twice before expressing your feelings, or are becoming less trusting of or starting to play games with your partner (avoidant traits), it is a huge warning sign and very likely that you’re with the wrong person

If you’re still in the relationship, remember that just because you can get along with anyone doesn’t mean you have to.

better to find a way to heal the wounds and maintain the hope that there are other people out there who share your need for intimacy and closeness. You can be happy again.

When the two people in a couple have colliding intimacy needs, their relationship is likely to become more of a storm-tossed voyage than a safe haven.


Yellow highlight | Page: 157
When couples disagree about the degree of closeness and intimacy desired in a relationship, the issue eventually threatens to dominate all of their dialogue.


Yellow highlight | Page: 158
every once in a while, when the avoidant partner makes him/herself available to the anxious partner, the latter’s attachment system is temporarily quieted and you achieve extreme closeness—leading to the feeling of a “high.” This closeness, however, is perceived as a threat by the avoidant partner and is quickly followed by withdrawal on his or her part—

act. If you’re avoidant, you often inflate your self-esteem and sense of independence in comparison to someone else.


Yellow highlight | Page: 158
Frequently avoidants feel independent and powerful only to the extent that their partner feels needy and incapable. This is one of the main reasons avoidants hardly ever date one another.


Blue highlight | Page: 158
They can’t feel strong and independent in relation to someone who shares the same sentiment


Blue highlight | Page: 158
The relationship may last for a long time, but an element of uncertainty persists. As illustrated here, you may remain together but with a feeling of chronic dissatisfaction,


Blue highlight | Page: 160
You may feel that you’re constantly fighting about things you shouldn’t be fighting about at all. In fact, your fights aren’t about these minor problems but about something else altogether—the amount of intimacy between you.


Blue highlight | Page: 160
If you are anxious, you find that you’re getting treated worse instead of better once you become the person closest to the avoidant partner.


Blue highlight | Page: 160
You develop the eerie sense that the relationship is not right for you, but you feel too emotionally connected to the other person to leave.


Blue highlight | Page: 160
the anxious partner is usually the one who has to make concessions and accept the rules imposed by the avoidant partner.


Blue highlight | Page: 161
These differences reflect diametrically opposed desires, assumptions, and attitudes. In fact, they affect almost every aspect of a shared life; from the way you sleep together to how you raise your children.


Blue highlight | Page: 161
With every new development in the relationship (getting married, having kids, moving to a new home, making money, or becoming ill) these basic differences will manifest themselves,


Blue highlight | Page: 161
While people with an anxious or secure attachment style seek to resolve a disagreement to achieve greater emotional closeness, this outcome is uncomfortable for the avoidant who actually seeks to remain distant.


Blue highlight | Page: 162
During bitter fights between anxious and avoidant partners, when there are no secure checks and balances in place, people with anxious attachment style tend to get overwhelmed by negative emotions. When they feel hurt, they talk, think, and act in an extreme manner, even to the point of threatening to leave (protest behavior).


Blue highlight | Page: 162
once they calm down, they become flooded with positive memories and are then overcome with regret. They reach out to their partner in an attempt to reconcile. But they are often met with a hostile response, because avoidants react differently to a fight. They turn off all attachment-related memories and remember the worst of their partner.


Blue highlight | Page: 163
Studies have found that security “priming”—reminding people of security-enhancing experiences they’ve had—can help them to create a greater sense of security.


Blue highlight | Page: 164
As a person’s attachment style gradually changes toward greater security, he or she behaves more constructively in relationships and even enjoys better mental and physical health.


Blue highlight | Page: 164
To find such a role model, mentally review the various people in your life, past and present. The secure presence can be someone close like a parent or a sibling, or it may be someone you know more casually from work or through friends. What’s important is that this person has a secure attachment style and a secure way of dealing with people.

we don’t assume our pets are doing things purposely to hurt us, we don’t hold grudges even when they eat something they shouldn’t or make a mess, we still greet them warmly when we come home (even after a rough day at the office), and we stick by them no matter what.

Taking the inventory is a task that should be done alone. Make sure to set aside enough quiet time to work on it thoroughly, so you really get a complete and accurate picture of yourself from an attachment perspective. Start by listing, in the left-hand column (1), the names of all your romantic partners, past and present. These can include people you’ve dated briefly. We suggest working vertically, one column at a time. Completing the inventory vertically encourages you to focus less on each particular scenario and to achieve an integrated picture of your working model across relationships. The more information you gather, the better. In column 2, write what you remember about the relationship: what it was like and what things stand out most when you try to recall your time together. Once you write down your general recollections of the relationship, column 3 allows you to take a closer look and identify specific scenarios that contribute to activation/deactivation of your attachment system. Column 4 asks how you responded to these situations: What did you do? What were you thinking? How did you feel? The lists below the inventory are provided to help you recall these reactions. Column 5 is a crucial next step. You will need to reassess these experiences from an attachment perspective to gain insight into the issues that affected your relationships.…

MAKE BECOMING SECURE AN ONGOING GROWTH PROCESS Remember that attachment styles are stable and plastic—becoming more secure is an ongoing process. Whenever a new concern, dissatisfaction, or conflict occurs, enter the new information. This will help in your quest to break your insecure patterns. But moving toward security is not only about tackling problems in your relationship; it’s also about having fun together. Find ways to enjoy your time together as

Emotionally Focused Therapy (EFT) has demonstrated through her clinical work and writings that creating true security in the relationship and recognizing that you are emotionally dependent on your partner on every level is the best way to improve your romantic bond.

When you build a secure relationship, both individuals win: If you are the anxious partner, you get the closeness you crave, and if you’re the avoidant partner, you’ll enjoy much more of the independence you need.


Blue highlight | Page: 189
when people are in an anxious-avoidant relationship, especially when they are unable to move to greater security, these discrepancies will always be a part of their lives and will never completely disappear.


Blue highlight | Page: 190
can be very valuable to know that your ongoing struggles as a couple are not because either of you is crazy, but rather because your relationship has a built-in clash that is not going to go away.


Blue highlight | Page: 190
One of the most important benefits of this insight has to do with your self-perception.


Blue highlight | Page: 190
in behaviors such as maintaining a high degree of secrecy and then blaming the other person of being jealous and needy, in preferring separate beds, and in finding ways to spend less time together. If you are with an avoidant partner, you are constantly being rejected and rebuffed. After experiencing these distancing strategies for a while, you start to blame yourself.


Blue highlight | Page: 190
You begin to feel unattractive and inadequate.


Blue highlight | Page: 190
Once you understand that your partner will always find areas of contention as a way of maintaining distance and that s/he will always need to withdraw, no matter whom s/he is with—you will no longer blame yourself for the relationship problems.

Avoidants need to actively suppress their attachment needs, but they tend to report being less happy in relationships.


Blue highlight | Page: 191
Other people do find a way to live in relative peace with colliding intimacy needs. How do they manage? They come to terms with the fact that when it comes to certain aspects of the relationship, things are not ever going to change.


Blue highlight | Page: 192
They learn to accept certain limitations and adopt a number of pragmatic life strategies: They admit to themselves that in certain areas, their mate is never going to be an active partner, and they stop urging him or her to change. They stop taking personal offense when their mate pushes them away and accept that this is simply his or her nature. They learn to do things on their own that they previously expected to do with their partner. They engage with like-minded friends in activities that their mate is unwilling to participate in. They learn to be thankful for what their mate does do and to overlook what he or she does not do.


Blue highlight | Page: 192
We know countless people who, after having struggled with ongoing intimacy conflicts, finally make a shift in their mind-set and find a compromise that they are able to live with: Doug, 53, used to get furious at his wife on a daily basis when she came home hours later than expected. He finally decided to stop getting mad when she walked in and to greet her warmly instead. He made a conscious decision to make home into a place she would want to come home to instead of a battlefield. Natalie, 38, always dreamed of sharing her leisure time with her husband. After years of resentment and bitter fights over his refusal to spend weekends together, she decided to change. Today she makes plans for herself. If he wants to join (as rarely happens), he’s welcome aboard. But if not, it’s “so long and see you later.” Janis, 43, is married to Larry. Larry, who was married before, doesn’t take an active role in raising their joint children. Janis has come to accept that when it comes to the kids (and several other areas of their life together), she is quite literally on her own. She no longer expects him to participate and no longer gets angry when he refuses to do so.

They compromise. But make no mistake: The compromise is in no way mutual; it is in fact wholly one-sided.

DECIDING TO LET GO OF THE DREAM


Blue highlight | Page: 193
Do we recommend taking this route? Our answer is—“It depends.” If you’re in an ongoing relationship riddled with intimacy clashes that you have not been able to resolve, and yet you want to remain in the bond for whatever reason, then yes, this is the only way to live in relative peace.

Throughout their hiking trip in Guatemala, instead of walking side by side and sharing the adventure, Gary would walk ahead of Sue, occasionally making snide comments about how lazy and incompetent she was for walking so slowly.


Blue highlight | Page: 196
Unfortunately, in these cases, anxious and avoidant people can bring out the worst in each other. “Abnormal” becomes the norm.


Blue highlight | Page: 196
there seems to be a gravitational pull between anxious and avoidant individuals, and once they become attached, it’s very hard for them to let go.

Afterward, I confronted Craig about his behavior. He said, “Marsha, when we’re in the company of other people, I don’t think they need to know we’re a couple.” His words made me furious and reduced me to tears. But then he hugged and kissed me, and I made up with him. Soon, despite Craig not acknowledging our relationship in public, it became apparent that we were indeed a couple.


Blue highlight | Page: 198
When I mentioned this to Craig, his response caught me off guard. “Why did you tell your ex that? It’s still very early and this might not lead to anything!”


Blue highlight | Page: 198
For one thing, Craig was always comparing me with his ex-girlfriend Ginger. According to Craig, she was perfect—smart, beautiful, interesting, and sophisticated. The fact that they still kept in touch was extremely difficult for me and made me feel unsure of myself.


Blue highlight | Page: 200
Because I was so deeply ashamed of the way Craig treated me—of the way I let him treat me—I never met my friends in his presence.


Blue highlight | Page: 200
He interrupted the speaker: “Hey, listen up, my ‘genius’ girlfriend wants to say something.” Another time, at the beach, I asked him for a towel and he shouted, “Dry yourself in the sun!” in front of everyone. These were just two instances. There were many, many others. I kept asking him not to speak to me that way, but eventually I gave up. The one aspect of our relationship that made things bearable—and allowed me to stay with him for so long—was that, despite his words, Craig was very affectionate. We hugged a lot and would fall asleep cuddling.


Blue highlight | Page: 201
Marriage was the one decision that I pressured Craig into. As soon as he agreed, I knew it was a mistake. That was evident from the word “go.” The ring he bought was unimpressive and the stones kept falling out.

I began to fantasize that he would fall in love with someone else and leave, because I was afraid I’d never have the strength to leave him first.

creating uncertainty at the beginning of their relationship, keeping their status unclear, having to be “pushed” into marriage, belittling her, avoiding sex, and using numerous other deactivating strategies.

Craig’s inflated self-esteem (an avoidant characteristic) fed off Marsha’s increasing self-doubt (an anxious characteristic).

Avoidants often use sex to distance themselves from their partner. It doesn’t necessarily mean they will cheat on their partner, although studies have shown that they are more likely to do so than other attachment types.


Blue highlight | Page: 203
of the three styles, avoidants would more readily make a pass at someone else’s partner or respond to such a proposition.


Blue highlight | Page: 204
avoidants have very different preferences. They might choose to focus only on the sexual act itself, forgoing holding and cuddling, or to put rules into place like “no kissing” in order to make sex feel less intimate. Others might have sex only rarely—or never—with their partner, or fantasize about others while doing so.


Blue highlight | Page: 204
couples may use fantasy to spice up their sex life, but they do so as a way to get closer. With avoidants, fantasy is not part of a mutual adventure but rather a deactivating strategy to keep them isolated.)


Blue highlight | Page: 204
Researchers believe that in relationships like Marsha and Craig’s, there is less lovemaking because the anxious partner wants a great deal of physical closeness and this in turn causes the avoidant partner to withdraw further.


Blue highlight | Page: 204
it’s been found that the anxious partner uses sex to achieve a sense of affirmation and as a barometer of attractiveness

Craig treated Marsha as if she were the enemy,


Blue highlight | Page: 205
Of all the people in the world, she was the one closest to him, and yet he treated her the worst.


Blue highlight | Page: 205
Marsha wasn’t aware that Craig treated her so badly not in spite of her being closest but because she was closest.


Blue highlight | Page: 205
She was now living within Craig’s inner circle. When our partners join our inner circle, we become close to them in a way that we can be only with our closest relatives—


Blue highlight | Page: 205
life in the inner circle for an anxious-avoidant couple is not a bed of roses.


Blue highlight | Page: 206
Once Marsha crossed that line with Craig, she got too close for comfort and became the enemy.


Blue highlight | Page: 207
THE INNER CIRCLE WHEN YOU’RE TREATED LIKE ROYALTY Your well-being comes second to none. You are confided in first. Your opinion matters most. You feel admired and protected. Your need for closeness is rewarded with even more closeness. Many people in anxious-avoidant relationships think that the “royal inner circle” doesn’t really exist, and that all people have the same inner-circle experience.


Blue highlight | Page: 208
Many people who live in an avoidant-anxious trap have a hard time admitting to themselves and others that they are in a bad predicament.

As painful as it is to be mistreated by your partner, severing an attachment bond is even more excruciating.

The emotional circuits that make up our attachment system evolved to discourage us from being alone.

Studies have found that the same areas in the brain that light up in imaging scans when we break a leg are activated when we split up with our mate.

When rat pups are separated from their mothers, a number of physiological reactions occur: their activity level goes down, their heart rate goes down, and so does their growth hormone level.


Blue highlight | Page: 210
only one intervention alleviated all the symptoms at once, and that was the reunion with their mother.


Blue highlight | Page: 210
When we break up with someone, our attachment system goes into overdrive, and just like the rat pups, we can think of nothing but getting back together with our loved one. The fact that one person can take away all our discomfort in a split second makes it very hard to resist the temptation to see him or her again.


Blue highlight | Page: 211
Only when every single cell in their body is completely convinced that there is no chance that their partner will change or that they will ever reunite will they be able to deactivate and let go.

Long before she actually made a break, Marsha had been unconsciously preparing her escape by beginning to deactivate her attachment system.

In order to avoid becoming too close, they focus on their partner’s negative qualities and behaviors to keep their partner at bay.

Ask yourself what life is like for you in the “inner circle.” If you can’t decide to break up, ask yourself whether you are treated like royalty or like the enemy.

Don’t be ashamed if you slip up and go back to “the scene of the crime.” Obviously you’re better off not reestablishing contact with your ex, but if you end up doing so, don’t beat yourself up. It is very important that you be compassionate with yourself. The worse you feel about yourself, the more you’ll want to go back to the false safety of the bad relationship you were in.


Blue highlight | Page: 214
If you’re having a hard time, don’t feel guilty. Remember, the pain is real! Friends might urge you to forget about your ex, stop feeling sorry for yourself, and move on quickly. But we know that the pain you’re feeling is real,

Know that no matter how much pain you’re going through now, it will pass. Most people recover very well from a broken heart and eventually move on to greener pastures!

Lauren’s story is an excellent example of the importance of effective communication. Expressing your needs and expectations to your partner in a direct, nonaccusatory manner is an incredibly powerful tool.


Blue highlight | Page: 221
If Ethan’s behavior was simply a manifestation of his attachment style, effective communication would have uncovered that as well, and they would have both benefited from discovering early on that their attachment styles were incompatible.


Blue highlight | Page: 222
People’s response to effective communication is always very telling. It either allows you to avoid getting involved in a dead-end relationship, as in Lauren and Ethan’s case, or it helps bring the relationship to a deeper level, as in Serge and Tina’s case.


Blue highlight | Page: 222
Effective communication works on the understanding that we all have very specific needs in relationships, many of which are determined by your attachment style. They aren’t good or bad, they simply are what they are.


Blue highlight | Page: 222
If you’re anxious, you have a strong need for closeness and have to be reassured at all times that your partner loves and respects you. If you’re avoidant, you need to be able to maintain some distance, either emotional or physical, from your partner and preserve a large degree of separateness. In order to be happy in a relationship, we need to find a way to communicate our attachment needs clearly


Blue highlight | Page: 223
If the other person shows a sincere wish to understand your needs and put your well-being first, your future together has promise. If he or she brushes your concerns aside as insignificant, or makes you feel inadequate, foolish, or self-indulgent, you can conclude that this person doesn’t sincerely have your best interests in mind and you are probably incompatible.


Blue highlight | Page: 224
JUDGING THE RESPONSE With effective communication, you might not be able to solve a problem or resolve your differences in one shot. But you can judge immediately how important your well-being is to your partner: Does s/he try to get to the bottom of your concerns? Does s/he respond to the issue at hand or does s/he try to dodge you? Does s/he take your concerns seriously or does s/he try to belittle you or make you feel foolish for raising them? Does s/he try to find ways to make you feel better or is s/he only busy acting defensive? Is s/he replying to your concerns only factually (as in a court of law) or is s/he also in tune with your emotional well-being?


Blue highlight | Page: 225
insecure people cannot get in touch with what is really bothering them. They get overwhelmed by emotions and lash out. Studies show that people with a secure attachment style don’t react so strongly, don’t get overwhelmed as easily, and can thus calmly and effectively communicate their own feelings and tend to the needs of their partners. Secure people also believe that they are worthy of love and affection, and expect their partners to be responsive and caring.

Finally, after several months of frustration, he confronted Monica. He knows her involvement stems from worry and concern, but instead of helping, it only serves to remind him again and again of his condition. He trusted his doctor and felt that there was no need for further inquiry. He felt that Monica’s behavior was not only ineffective in improving his health but also harmful to their relationship. Monica realized that she wasn’t helping Andres—it was her way of dealing with such a diagnosis, but it wasn’t his. She understood that she could be a better, more supportive partner by respecting his wishes instead of trying to force her own.

If you are anxious—turn to effective communication when you feel you are starting to resort to protest behavior.


Blue highlight | Page: 234
If you are avoidant—the surefire sign that you need to use effective communication is when you feel an irrepressible need to bolt. Use effective communication to explain to your partner that you need some space and that you’d like to find a way of doing so that is acceptable to him or her. Suggest a few alternatives, making sure that the other person’s needs are taken care of.

IT’S NEVER TOO LATE TO USE EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION, EVEN IF YOU START OFF ON THE WRONG FOOT

Larry realized what his behavior was really all about: He was edgy because of the e-mail from work and wanted the security of having Sheila close by, but wasn’t comfortable asking her to change her plans. He’d instinctively launched into protest behavior, picking a fight just to engage her.

Wear your heart on your sleeve. Effective communication requires being genuine and completely honest

Focus on your needs. The idea is to get your needs across. When expressing your needs, we are always referring to needs that take your partner’s well-being into consideration


Blue highlight | Page: 236
Be specific. If you speak in general terms, your partner may not understand exactly what you really need,

colleague of ours, Diane, used to joke about guys who would “Mirandize” her, i.e., inform her of what she had a “right” to expect when dating them. “I don’t think that I’m ready for commitment,” they would say, meaning, “If it doesn’t work out, don’t say I didn’t warn you.” Apparently, like the police, who are protected legally while they interrogate a suspect, these guys felt absolved of any emotional responsibility toward Diane once they had laid down “the law.”

What’s vital is your partner’s response—whether he or she is concerned about your well-being, has your best interests in mind, and is willing to work on things.

major misconception about conflict in romantic relationships is that people in good relationships should fight very little. There’s an expectation that, if well matched, you and your partner will see eye to eye on most matters and argue rarely, if at all.

BREAD-AND-BUTTER CONFLICTS As the name suggests, bread-and-butter conflicts are those disputes that inevitably arise when separate wills and personalities share daily life—which channel to watch, what temperature to set the air conditioning on, whether to order Chinese or Indian. Such disagreements are actually good because they force you to live in relation to someone else

Five Secure Principles for Resolving Conflict Show basic concern for the other person’s well-being. Maintain focus on the problem at hand. Refrain from generalizing the conflict. Be willing to engage. Effectively communicate feelings and needs.

WHY INSECURE PEOPLE DON’T APPROACH CONFLICT HEAD-ON


Blue highlight | Page: 252
For the anxious, conflict can trigger very basic concerns about their partner’s responsiveness to their needs and about rejection or abandonment.


Blue highlight | Page: 253
People with an avoidant attachment style are also threatened by the possibility that their mate won’t really be there for them when needed. However, to deal with these beliefs, they adopt the opposite approach—they suppress their need for intimacy by shutting down emotionally and adopting a defensive air of independence. The more personal the conflict becomes, the stronger their urge grows to distance themselves from the situation. To do this they use deactivating strategies—such as finding fault with their partner—in order to feel less close to him or her.


Blue highlight | Page: 256
Insecure assumptions interfere with conflict resolution. Specifically, being centered on your own needs and hurts can cause a lot of trouble. Fear that someone isn’t as emotionally involved as you, or doesn’t want to be as close as you’d like to be, is understandable. But in conflict situations, such preoccupations can be very damaging.


Blue highlight | Page: 256
A single fight is not a relationship breaker. Express your fears! Don’t let them dictate your actions. If you’re afraid that s/he wants to reject you, say so. Don’t assume you are to blame for your partner’s bad mood. It is most likely not because of you. Trust that your partner will be caring and responsive and go ahead and express your needs. Don’t expect your partner to know what you’re thinking. If you haven’t told him/her what’s on your mind, s/he doesn’t know! Don’t assume that you understand what your partner means.

I do this out of habit, but I realize now that it’s upsetting and disrespectful toward you. After all, I get upset when other men look at you even if you’re not aware of it! I’ll try to be more respectful, but if I lapse, I want you to call me on it.”
